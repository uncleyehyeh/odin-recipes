    <h3>How To Make Tebasaki Yakitori</h3>
    <p>Tebasaki (手羽先) means "chicken wings" in Japan. The most popular part of the wing is not the tip, which is best saved to add its collagen to a soup or broth, nor is it the meaty drummette! The middle section with two bones (equivalent to the radius and the ulna) and plenty of fatty skin is favored for yakitori skewers. Nagoya City in Aichi Prefecture (central Japan) is famous for its deep-fried spicy chicken wings. This yakitori is enjoyed all over Japan, sometimes simmered then grilled, other times, simply grilled with a little salt the better to savor its crispy skin.</p>
